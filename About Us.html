	   I'm Angelo Dela Cruz.  I'm 15 years old and my birthday is on November 20. I like reading books and looking for ways for self-improvement. Whenever I have free time, I would spend that time playing games or reflecting on something that has piqued my curiosity. As an introvert, I only like to socialize with those who've given much trust in me and I to them. <br><br>
       As a student of PSHS, I feel that I'm inclined to share what I know about Science and Technology to those who know less of it. The Philippines as a country still has a long way to go from achieving the kind of development that First World Countries are enjoying. I feel that I can help in our journey, as a country, to a better future for everyone through my commitment to truth, excellence, and service.</i>

		I'm Jose Renzo Delos Santos, 15 years old, born on June 19, 2003. I like binge watching shows and movies, gaming, and playing Frisbee or basketball. Whenever I'm bored I just sleep, workout, or listen to music. I'm pretty chill and I take things lightly and positively because I don't want to overthink and get stressed out. I'm not good at talking to people I just met, but once we get a long things get better.<br><br>
        As a student of Pisay I try my best to improve daily and what's cool is  the fact that the overall environment is fun because of activities like the fair and also cuz of the people around me. At the end I just strive to understand every lesson, learn from mistakes, and do my best

		Hi! I'm Alano Louis N. Ines, 14 years old, born on June 4, 2004. I like anime, video games, playing instruments such as the guitar, and sports like football, frisbee, and basketball. I can usually be found sleeping, lying down, or playing games/music. I like to take things slow, and having a chill approach towards life.<br><br>
        As a student/future scientist, I'd strive for solutions to problems in society, and aim to make the standard of living better, allowing comfort for the masses. I believe that I can contribute in allowing people to have a chill approach in life, just like me right now, through the improvements and innovations in science and technology.</i>

		I’m Frank Lloyd Miranda.  I’m 15 years old and my birthday is on September 3. Singing and sleeping are two of my favorite things to do. In my spare time, I usually just workout or listen to music because that’s what relaxes me the most. Ultimate frisbee is the only sport that I’m focusing on right now even though I’ve played basketball and table tennis.  I really love the game, community,  and the spirit involved in the sport. It really makes me happy and motivated to become stronger physically and mentally.  I’m kind of an outgoing person.  I like socializing, making friends,  and talking with others but for some reason I still have difficulty in front of big crowds.<br><br>
        I study here in Pisay and I really like the community that comes with it but the curriculum isn’t really that favorable for me. However, the people around me make up for all of the problems I encounter. I also know that this school's program and curriculum will enrich us as scholars and as the future scientists of this country,  to innovate and create for the people.</i>

		I am Katrina Angela Tabagan. I am currently 14 years old and my birthday is on September 24. I like watching Netflix and learning new instruments. I decorate my room when I have free time. I also like playing volleyball because it brings me to meet people who share the same interest. I am very open to a lot of people about my life.<br><br>  
        As a student of a school where science and technology are at most relevant, I will put a lot of effort to understand the lessons and values that were taught. I will learn to recognize the importance of science and technology today in order to utilize the practicality of the said expertise.</i>
