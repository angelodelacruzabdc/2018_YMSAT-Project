      <i style="font-size: 30px;">Science and Technology are two of the most important fields of study in modern society, that much is obvious. 
However, it is not made known that there are aspects of science and technology that are under-developed in our country. 
As such, we aim to inform about the status quo, and what we can do to contribute to our nation through scientific and technological advancements and innovations.

        STATE OF SCIENCE

    <div class="subheadc1">
        <div class="white"><i style="font-size: 30px;">"Innovation in our country exists, but not as much as we would like."</i><br><br></div>
      <i style="font-size: 18px;">The state of science and technology in the Philippines is currently still at a developmental stage. A lot of people have not yet fully embraced the blessings that science and technology has brought them in the past few years. In terms of innovation, we are far behind our fellow Asian neighbors such as China, Japan, and Korea which are established world leaders when it comes to technological and scientific advancements. Today, the Philippines is still a long way to go from our goal to be a country hugely capable in the scientific and technological departments.</i>

        UTILITY OF SCIENCE

    <div class="subheadc2">
        <div class="white"><i style="font-size: 30px">"Science and technology is the most widespread now more than ever."</i><br><br></div>
      <i style="font-size: 18px;">Science and technology can be seen almost everywhere here in Manila. In 2017, it has been estimated that around 30.4 million Filipinos are using cellphones for their everyday life. Technology, especially for city-dwellers, have become such an important pillar of life here that the whole economy would slow down without it. Science and Technology can be seen in many aspects of our life and itsâ€™ spread is inevitable and will come slowly but surely.</i>

      <i style="font-size: 18px;">As a Third World Country, the Philippines faces a lot of challenges when it comes to the different scientific sectors here. As such, Filipinos have taken up to these challenges and have proposed and succeeded in making numerous solutions to these everyday problems that we continue to face. With that, great changes have occured in our scientific and technological which have greatly improved the lives of everyone here in the Philippines.</i>
